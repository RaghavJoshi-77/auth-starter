Of course. Based on your project's evolution into a CLI tool and the specific tech stack you're using, here is a completely rewritten, modern `README.md`.

This new README is designed for users who will discover your project on npm and use it with `npx`.

## Usage

Getting started is as simple as running one command. This will create a new directory, scaffold your project, and provide you with the next steps.

```bash
npx create-next-auth-starter my-app
```

That's it\! The CLI will handle the rest.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (After Installation)

Once the CLI has created your project, follow these steps to get your development server running:

### 1\. Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd my-app
```

### 2\. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your new project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required values:

```env
# Database (Get this from your Neon project dashboard)
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host/dbname"

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET= # Generate a secret using: `openssl rand -hex 32`
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4\. Push Database Schema

This project uses Drizzle ORM. To push your schema (defined in the `/drizzle` folder) to your Neon database, run the following command:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

**Note**: You may need to add this script to your `package.json` if it doesn't exist:
`"db:push": "drizzle-kit push:pg"`

### 5\. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your application running.
