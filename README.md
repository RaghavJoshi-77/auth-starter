## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18.x or later)
  * npm, yarn, or pnpm
  * A code editor of your choice (e.g., VS Code)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RaghavJoshi-77/auth-starter.git
    cd auth-starter
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables.

    ```bash
    # GitHub OAuth
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=

    # Google OAuth
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

    # NextAuth.js
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET= # Generate a secret using: `openssl rand -hex 32`

    # Database
    DATABASE_URL= # Your database connection string
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

This starter template provides a foundation for building your application with authentication. You can start by:

  * **Adding new pages**: Create new pages in the `pages` or `app` directory.
  * **Customizing the UI**: Modify the components in the `components` directory to match your design.
  * **Extending authentication**: Add more OAuth providers or implement email/password login by configuring `[...nextauth].js`.
  * **Building your API**: Create API routes in the `pages/api` or `app/api` directory to handle your application's logic.
